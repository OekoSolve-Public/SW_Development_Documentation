## Widget Development

This documentation contains the most important information on how to develop [widgets](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-library/) for [ThingsBoard](https://thingsboard.io/) without going crazy, because the current documentation on the development of [widgets](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/ui/widget-library/) is very sparse and seperated over multiple websites.
